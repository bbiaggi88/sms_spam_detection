# SMS Spam Detection

This project implements an SMS spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content.

## Project Description

Spam detection is an essential task for maintaining the integrity of communication platforms. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. The main steps in this project include data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bbiaggi88/sms_spam_detection.git
cd sms_spam_detection
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

 ```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the required packages

 ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the SMS spam detection analysis, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `sms_spam_detection.ipynb` file.

```
jupyter notebook sms_spam_detection.ipynb
```

In the notebook, you will find the complete workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
